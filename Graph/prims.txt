- DS-Visited set, priority_queue<pair>, unordered_map

- insert the pair of the {-1, src} int the priority_queue
- one by one remove the root element of the priority_queue
- if the root element is already visited then we will just continue.
- if the root element is not visited then we will mark the root as the visited
- we store the weight of the pair in the ans
- update the mapping
- go to every neighbor of the curr element, and only add those which are non visited and have a better weight proposition

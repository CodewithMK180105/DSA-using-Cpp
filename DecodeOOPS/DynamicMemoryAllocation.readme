The below given eg are the Static Memory Location, done at the compile time using the stack memory.

int a=5;
char ch='e';
Player a;


The below given eg are the Dynamic Memory Location, done at the Run time using the heap memory.

int *a=new int(5);
char *ch=new char('e');
Player *a= new Player();

Dynamic memory allocation is achieved using pointers.
